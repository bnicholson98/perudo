# Claude Agent Rules

This file tracks agent-specific rules and conventions established during development conversations.

## Development Guidelines

### Project Context

- **Purpose**: Personal/learning project

### Agent Instructions
- Always ask clarification questions before implementing features
- Keep documentation up-to-date as the project evolves
- **Always commit previous changes before starting new work**

### Commit Strategy
- **Commit early and often**: Make commits after completing logical units of work
- **Before new features**: Always check `git status` and commit any uncommitted changes
- **Before fixes/changes**: Commit the current state before implementing requested changes
- **Commit messages**: Use descriptive messages with bullet points for multiple changes
- Include the Claude Code footer in all commits

### Updating This File
- **When to update**: Add new rules only when explicitly requested by the user
- **What to add**: Agent-specific conventions, workflow preferences, and project-specific guidelines
- **What NOT to add**: Game rules, implementation details, or general programming practices
- Keep this file focused on how the agent should work with the user on this project
