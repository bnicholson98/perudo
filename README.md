Perudo
- 2-6 players
- Each player has 5 dice and a cup
- Last player with dice remaining wins
- Each player rolls dice in secret and looks at their values
- The first player makes a bid about the total number of a face value among all dice rolled (e.g. five 3s)
- Turn proceeds clockwise and each player bids:
	- Increase the quantity
	- Increase the face value
- One are wild
- Bidding on a 1:
	- May half the previous quantity (rounding up) and bid on face value 1
- Bidding away from a 1:
	- Must double the quantity and add 1, may select any face value.
- Calza: may call for the exact previous bid to be correct in order to gain a die
- Max dice is five
- Call 'Dudo' instead of bidding:
	- Dice are revealed
	- If the bid is wrong, bidder loses a die
	- If the bid is correct, challenger loses a die
- Palifico round:
	- When a player is reduced to one die (only happens once per player), the face value of the bid stays the same, ones are no longer wild
